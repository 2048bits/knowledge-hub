Knowledge Hub is a place where we, as 2048its, are storing all valuable sources of knowledge in many different shapes - articles, books, courses, videos or tools.

Sources are divided in groups and sections and some of them have assigned labels with specific meaning:

* ✅ - Confirmed
* ⚠️ - Not confirmed
* 💙 - Recommended
* 🎬 - Video
* 📕 - Book
* 💲- Paid
* **\[BASIC\]** - Basic level
* **\[ADVANCED\]** - Advanced level
* **\[EXPERT\]** - Expert level
